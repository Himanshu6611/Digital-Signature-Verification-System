# Digital-Signature-Verification-System
This project implements a digital signature verification system that captures signatures using a touchscreen canvas, extracts features such as stroke shape, speed, and pressure, and compares two samples using DTW-based similarity. It enables enrollment and authentication for secure, real-time signature verification.
